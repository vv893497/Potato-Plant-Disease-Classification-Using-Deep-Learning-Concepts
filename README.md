Detection Accuracy: 96.7%
Note: These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.


## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
In the initial epoch, the training data exhibited an accuracy of 46%, accompanied by a loss of 61%. Notably, a remarkable improvement was observed in the accuracy, reaching 97% with a minimal loss of 0.05%. Conversely, on the validation data, the accuracy started at 43% with a corresponding loss of 59% in the first epoch. Subsequently, by the 10th epoch, a substantial enhancement was observed, with an accuracy of 92% and a loss of 12%.

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
